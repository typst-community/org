This document describes the governance structure of the project and how decisions are made.

## Organization Governance
The following member(s) hold ownership positions over the organization:
- [@huwaireb]
- [@tingerrr]

> [!NOTE]
> The numbers of owners is intentionally kept small to allow for quick decision making, and a reduced surface area for attacks. More members may be added as the organization grows through, most likely, a consensus processes, undefined currently.

This means, by default, they have administrative power over the organization, including the ability to add/remove members, create/delete repositories, and manage the organization's settings. This is a consequence of centralization, and is not ideal. However, it is a necessary evil for the time being. We welcome any suggestions on how to improve this, if you have an idea please open an [issue](https://github.com/typst-community/org/issues/new).
