### Who runs this?
This organization is run by volunteer Typst users, unaffiliated with the official [Typst](https://typst.app) project. Please see the [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) file for the current governance structure. and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved (everyone is welcome).

### Why an organization?
Unity is essential for any community to thrive. While decentralization may seem like a good idea, it can actually be harmful, leading to fragmentation and a lack of direction. Although open-source communities are typically decentralized, many have found success in creating a centralized entity to connect the community. We aim to follow their example to reduce fragmentation.

These communities in question are the [coq-community](https://github.com/coq-community) and [nix-community](https://github.com/nix-community) communities. 

### What are its goals?
We follow, in essence, the same goals as the other communities. Namely:

#### Collaborative maintenance of Typst projects
We aim to provide a central location for the maintenance of Typst projects.

Projects can be hosted in typst-community whenever any of the following is the case:
- **The** author stopped maintaining the project.
  - Projects which are unmaintaned are placed under governance of the Nursery team, see [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md#Nursery).
- **The** project has become a collective work, as several community members are actively working on it.
- **The** author is still maintaining the project but they want to encourage other community members to participate in its maintenance and possibly take over.
- **The** project is a tool of general interest and it makes sense to develop it collaboratively.
